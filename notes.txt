Commands are used for state changes
Events are statements of fact about what change has been made to the state
There should be a single command handler per command
Commands can emit any number of Events


What events exist and how does everything work together?
- DamageEvent ([Target] takes [Amount] of damage from [Source])
- OnHitEvent ([Target] hit by [Source])
- CombatInstigated ([Source] instigates combat against [Target])

Should there be an Attack object?
    - Power
    - Damage Type(s)
    - Source?
    - Target?

How should items work?
    - Modifiers that grant constant attribute bonuses
        - e.g. +5 Strength
    - Modifiers that grant event-based bonuses
        - e.g. +5 damage to Goblins
    - Base [CombatStats] -> Rename to weapon?
        ToHit, Power
    - Base [Armor]
        AC, EV
    - Stackable (Quantity)
        - Arrows, weapons in general?
    - Consumable?
        - Potions, etc

There should be triggers on certain events/conditions
    - Effect (intrinsic effect or triggered)
    - Condition (target meets certain criteria, source meets certain criteria)

THERE SHOULD BE TRIGGERS THAT TRIGGER ON EVENT::CLASS
    - e.g. Triggers[DamageEvent::Class]. Figure it out from entity actions.
