How do we handle the game area stuff?

1. The "World" is just the container for ECS stuff, not the dungeon. Duh :-p
2. That means we need some other objec that contains the world - here comes the Game ;)
3. At some point, do I just try Artemis ODB again?
4. I really don't think I need systems, etc. I just really want attributes.

1. The Dungeon is essentially a 3D space, where each Z area is a floor (duh ;)
2. How does it get drawn?
    Since it is a game area, it is a list of Tiles (which inherit(?) from Block which is 3D)
